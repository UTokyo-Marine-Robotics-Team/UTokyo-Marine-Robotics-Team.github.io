This is an example project page describing a concept design for an AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle).

## Goals

- Stable attitude control underwater
- Autonomous navigation along a planned route
- Sensor data acquisition and logging

## Key components

- **Mechanical**: pressure hull, waterproof connectors, thruster configuration
- **Electrical**: power design, wiring, EMI considerations
- **Software**: state estimation, path planning, fail-safe behavior

We’ll expand this page with design details and experimental results as the project evolves.
