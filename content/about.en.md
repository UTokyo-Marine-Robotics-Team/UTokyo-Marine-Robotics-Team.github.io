## Pioneering the Future of the Ocean with Robotics

The vast and mysterious ocean. In its depths lies a world still unknown to humankind. Through developing robots that autonomously navigate the seas and collect data, we pursue new possibilities in marine exploration.

Underwater robots are expected to play vital roles in diverse fields: oceanographic research, seabed resource exploration, infrastructure inspection, and environmental monitoring. Our team integrates **mechanical engineering**, **electrical and electronic engineering**, and **computer science** to design and build practical robotic systems.
